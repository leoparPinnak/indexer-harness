# Workspace Controller

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

## Summary

`@deepseek-ai/dsh-api-workspace-controller` owns the Host `ctx.workspaceController` service and the generated Client `ctx.remote.workspace` namespace. Its Remote methods create, rename, remove, and reorder Workspaces, reorder Sessions within a Workspace, archive Sessions from Workspace navigation, star and unstar Sessions in the favorites document, and follow the complete Workspace projection. Use it through API Gateway when a Client must change or follow Workspace navigation. The package also owns `ctx.directoryPickerController` and the generated `ctx.remote.directoryPicker` namespace, because the directory-picking seam it carries is abstract and never a Loader entry of its own.

## Use this package

The Host controller serializes mutations whose correctness depends on current registry state and throws `RemoteError` with a stable `workspace/*` or `directory-picker/*` code for expected failures. Its `follow()` stream synchronously attaches to durable Workspace changes, emits one complete baseline first, then emits ordered `upsert`, `remove`, `order`, and `archived` increments. A reconnect starts another generation with a replacement baseline, so consumers do not depend on receiving every increment while disconnected.

The Client entry provides `ClientWorkspaceModel` and `createWorkspaceStateStream()`. The model owns Workspace rows, registry order, archived Session ids, unary mutation echoes, and stream/unary race resolution. A newer Host row wins by `updatedAt`; a committed stream order outranks an older unary response; a removed Workspace id cannot be resurrected by delayed data. The package exposes framework-neutral snapshots and subscriptions, leaving navigation policy and React hooks to the UI owner.

Session favorites are one JSON document (`{"sessionIds": [...]}` in star order) whose absolute path comes from the required `favoritesFile` config field; the Web bundle points it at `sessions/favorites.json` inside the deployment's `$DSH_HOME`. `listFavorites` reads it and `setFavorite` rewrites it through an atomic write, serialized so two toggles cannot interleave. An absent document reads as empty, a malformed one fails with the path in the message, and the Client model carries the resulting order in the same snapshot as the archive set. Favorites only name Sessions: opening one navigates to that Session, and the document is never copied into a Session log.

## Model Experience

None, as Workspace organization and Session favorites are browser and Host control state and register no prompt, tool, or session event.

#### KV Cache effect

No direct effect; Workspace mutations do not alter model requests.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

<a id="known-limitations-and-deferred-work"></a>

- `follow()` replaces the whole projection after reconnect and has no durable cursor or incremental catch-up protocol.
- Process-local deletion markers prevent delayed data from reviving a removed Workspace only for the lifetime of the Client model.
- The favorites document is deployment-global and untracked by the Workspace stream: another Client's toggle appears here only on the next boot or carrier reconnect, and a Session id stays listed after its Session is deleted (rows for missing Sessions are skipped by the UI).

None.

**Runtime invariant:** No companion is published. Workspace Registry owns persistence; every stream generation is a full projection.
